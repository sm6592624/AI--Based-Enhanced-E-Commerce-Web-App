A modern e-commerce web application built with React, featuring an AI-powered styling assistant to help users discover products that match their personal style preferences.

## What's Inside

This project started as an experiment to combine modern web development with artificial intelligence to create a better shopping experience. Here's what I've built so far:

**AI Styling Assistant**
The core feature is an AI-powered stylist that analyzes user preferences and suggests products. While still in development, it demonstrates how machine learning can personalize the shopping experience.

**Complete Shopping Experience**
- Browse products with filtering and search capabilities
- Add items to cart and manage quantities
- User authentication with login/register functionality
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Clean, modern interface built with Tailwind CSS

**Key Pages**
- Homepage with featured products and hero section
- Product catalog with category filtering
- Individual product detail pages
- AI Stylist interface for personalized recommendations
- User profile and checkout pages
- Trends page showcasing popular items

## Demo

You can see the live application here: [Aura E-Commerce](https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app)

*Note: This is a portfolio project built for demonstration purposes. The AI features are prototypes and payment processing is simulated.*

## Technology Stack

I chose these technologies for their reliability and developer experience:

**Frontend Framework**
- React 19 with modern hooks and functional components
- React Router for client-side navigation
- Context API for state management (cart, authentication)

**Styling & UI**
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Headless UI for accessible components
- Heroicons for consistent iconography
- Responsive design principles

**Build & Development**
- Create React App for zero-config setup
- PostCSS and Autoprefixer for CSS processing
- ESLint for code quality

**Deployment**
- Vercel for hosting and continuous deployment
- GitHub for version control

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need Node.js installed on your machine.

**What you'll need:**
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

**Quick Setup:**

1. Clone this repository:
```bash

cd AI--Based-Enhanced-E-Commerce-Web-App
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create your environment file:
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys if you want to test the AI features:
```env

# Add other API keys as needed
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The app will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üöÄ Deployment

   npm run build
   ```

2. Drag and drop the `build` folder to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

## Project Structure

Here's how I organized the code:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/          # Reusable UI pieces
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Header.js       # Navigation bar
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Footer.js       # Site footer
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CartSidebar.js  # Shopping cart drawer
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/           # Login/register forms
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/              # Main application pages
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HomePage.js     # Landing page
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ShopPage.js     # Product browsing
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AiStylistPage.js # AI recommendation interface
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CheckoutPage.js # Purchase flow
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context/            # React state management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CartContext.js  # Shopping cart state
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AuthContext.js  # User authentication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/               # Mock data and product info
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Helper functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App.js              # Main application component
```

The styling uses Tailwind CSS classes throughout the components for a consistent design system.
